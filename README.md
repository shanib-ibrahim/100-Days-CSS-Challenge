# 100-Days-CSS-Challenge
Over the next 100 days, I'll be diving deep into CSS to refine my skills and elevate my animations. Each day, I'll craft a new design that pushes the boundaries of what's possible with CSS, focusing especially on enhancing my animation techniques.

## Why am I taking on this challenge?

- Brushing Up CSS Skills: I aim to strengthen my command over CSS properties, selectors, and layouts.

- Mastering Animations: I'm dedicated to mastering CSS animations, from subtle transitions to captivating effects that bring designs to life.
